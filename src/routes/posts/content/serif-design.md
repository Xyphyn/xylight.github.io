## Serifs and this design

I redesign my "portfolio" every so often just to get familiar with new technologies _(Svelte 5 for this website)_ and to experiment with new designs I've found.

Previously, I had a site that had a revolving star background with `three.js`, and before that, a monochrome design that I still use in a lot of projects such as [Photon](https://phtn.app).

Both were inspired by certain projects, the bento grid on the `three.js` site by (i forgot), and the monochrome design by **Vercel**.

Recently I've been using **Claude** as an LLM for certain questions, but my favorite part has to be the UI. I first noticed Anthropic using a unique design with their color scheme, an orange tint which I have not seen in a while.

Then, Claude 3.5 released and they redesigned the app. I hated it at first, but it started to grow on me. It was creative, I've never seen anything like this before.
